### Hallo Leute!! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently studying in the Spiced Academy + MDN, W3 SChools and ChatGPT's help)
- 🌱 I’m learning IT
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate with this industry
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with all-tech trends and IT related subjects
- 💬 Ask me about my songs, tell me unusual jokes, feel comfortable, we can be weird together
- 📫 How to reach me: By email or Whatsapp, but 'm not gonna lie: Answering phones is not my forte (I'm partially deaf), so avoid the audio approach, messages work better.

Things I love and cannot afford (for now) below =P I already possess one
