### Hallo Leute!! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying in the Spiced Academy + MDN, W3 SChools and ChatGPT's help)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning IT
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate with this industry
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all-tech trends and IT related subjects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my songs, tell me unusual jokes, feel comfortable, we can be weird together
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: By email or Whatsapp, but 'm not gonna lie: Answering phones is not my forte (I'm partially deaf), so avoid the audio approach, messages work better.

Things I love and cannot afford (for now) below =P I already possess one
